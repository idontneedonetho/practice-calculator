# practice-calculator
Just a practice calculator I'm working on. I'm adding all the features I can without importing anything.
* Main.py is the first attempt.
* Side.py is my second.
* Sub.py is V3, and you may be asking why. As sub.py isn't a complete rewrite and is essentially the same thing as side.py. I've made it V3 because I wanted to.
